1. Global Adoption Analysis: Analyse digital currency adoption trends across countries using historical transaction and usage data.
 	Tools: ggplot with python
 	Aim: Analyse Digital currency growth and spread through transaction volume.
 	Data:
 		Growth(transaction history) :	https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/
 			csv of different coins can be downloaded daily/weekly/monthly
        another site as well : https://www.coingecko.com/
        
 		DC history for Countries: chainalysis-Crypto Adoption Index: 2020-2025 (Chainalysis is a blockchain 					analytics company that helps governments, law enforcement agencies, and 					financial institutions track and investigate cryptocurrency transactions.)
 	Results:
 		Trend
 		Global adoption report

2. Economic Impact Visualisation: Explore relationships between cryptocurrency adoption and macroeconomic indicators (e.g., inflation, unemployment) using advanced visualisations like heatmaps and scatter plots.
 	Tools: ggplot with python
 	Aim: Understand the relationship between cryptocurrency adoption and macroeconomic indicators.
 	Macroeconomic indicators:
 		GDP    =>  https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD
 		Transaction volumes???
 		Demographic penetration
 		Inflation   => https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG
 		Unemployment  => https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS
 		interest rate  => https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FR.INR.RINR
 		Exchange Rates  => https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF
 		Financial Inclusion Indicators （ measure access, usage, and quality of financial services, focusing on key metrics like % of adults with an account, digital payment adoption, access to credit/savings, financial literacy, consumer protection, and mobile agent density）=> https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=g20-basic-set-of-financial-inclusion-indicators#
 		Government Debt (Debt-to-GDP Ratio) => https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.DOD.TOTL.GD.ZS
 	Data:
 		DC history for Countries:
 		Macroeconomic indicators data for countries:
 	Results:
 		Trend for each country
 		relationship between trend and each indicator for each country?

 
3. Blockchain Network Analysis: Utilise graph-based visualisation techniques to analyse blockchain transaction networks. Identify key nodes, transaction flows and anomalies.
 	Tools: networkx
 	Aim: visualize the "social network" of money:
 		Identify Key Nodes: Find the "hubs." Who are the most important players? (e.g., A Coinbase hot 				wallet, a massive "Whale" investor, or a dark web market).
 		Trace Transaction Flows: Follow the money. If $10M enters the network, where does it go? Does it 			disperse to thousands of people, or funnel into one account?
 		Detect Anomalies: Spot the weird stuff. Is a wallet behaving like a bot? Is someone "wash trading" 			(selling to themselves) to fake volume?

 	Results:
 		understand how digital currency flows in the network


4. National Security Implications: Apply anomaly detection techniques to visualise potential risks such as fraud, money laundering, or unauthorised cross-border transactions. Use interactive visualisations for enhanced understanding.
 	Tools: plotly
 	Aims: Anomaly detection = finding patterns that are different from normal behaviour.
 	What to do:
 		Design a system that can take transactions and highlight the risks, which means need to know the pattern of all the risks list above.



5. Policy Simulation Dashboard: Develop an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash to evaluate the impact of different regulatory policies on digital currency markets. Include metrics such as transaction compliance rates and fraud detection efficiency.
 	Tools: plotly
 	Aims: Simulate impacts on DC markets on different policies
 	What to do:
 		Design policies based on research and the results from above 4 qs.




6. Ethical Considerations in Data Visualisation: Critically evaluate the ethical implications of visualising sensitive financial data and propose strategies to balance transparency with privacy concerns.
